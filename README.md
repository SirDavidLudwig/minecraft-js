# MinecraftJs
A complete library to manage Minecraft versions, assets, launching, and logging.

## Available Modules
This is a complete list of the available modules in this library.

### Minecraft Launcher (TODO)
This module of the library will allow you to launch instances of Minecraft, from vanilla to modded. Once an instance is launched, you will have direct access to the stdin and stdout.

### Minecraft Launcher Profiles Management (TODO)
This module will allow you to generate and manipulate the `launcher_profiles.json` in your `.minecraft` folder. You can use this to add accounts and game profiles.

### Minecraft Version Management (TODO)
This module of the library will allow you to get a list of all available Minecraft versions to install, snapshot or release, and install them. You can also list or remove currently installed versions, including modded versions like Optifine and Forge, and perform integrity checks that can redownload any broken-missing libraries or assets.
